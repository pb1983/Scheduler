# Scheduler

### This project is a day-planner application that allows the user to log the events of each hour of a typical 9-5 workday. The calendar is color-coded so that there is a clear visual representation of how much of the day has passed, the current hour, and how many hours are left. There is also a date and time stamp at the top of the page with continuous second movement. Methods used to complete this assignment include:

* Use of local storage to keep user information in the text boxes after a page refresh.
* Dayjs API for the onboard clock and time comparison for color-coding.
* Class-selecting elements.
* Navigating the DOM via element parents and siblings. 
* Using for loops to iterate through objects that don't have unique identifiers.
